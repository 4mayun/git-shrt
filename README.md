# git-shrt

Just a little utility to have shortcuts for our git projects (using git bash for Windows and MinGW)

### Principle of use

The basic idea is you can open quickly your often used git repositories just by typing in the console ``git-shrt`` plus the name you gave to your shortcut.

It's based on a text file who have all shortcuts saved as ``shortcut:"path\project.git"``

Imagine that file contains that line of text: ``project1:"C:\Users\Public\Projects\One\one.git"``  
For that exemple: typing ``C:\>git-shrt project1`` in the windows cmd console will open git-bash in the repertory specified up there.

### Requirements

This is made for Windows (7 or 10) only

If you want to build this program using the batch script file, you NEED to have MinGW set up correctly on your computer.
