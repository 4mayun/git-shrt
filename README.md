# git-shrt:
> Shortcuts for git

Just a little utility to have shortcuts for our git projects (using git bash for Windows and MinGW)\
The basic idea is you can open quickly your often used git repositories just by typing in the console ``git-shrt`` plus the name you gave to your shortcut.\
It's based on a text file who have all shortcuts saved as ``shortcut:"C:\path\"`` (for exemple)
